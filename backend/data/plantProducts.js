        "Jade retains water in its round leaves, so it can sometimes survive more than a month without any attention whatsoever. 'If they do get water, they start to rehydrate and grow,' says Neil Mattson, an associate professor in the horticulture department at Cornell University. Position it in a sunny window (south- or west-facing, preferably) and water when the soil feels dry. Take note: This plant is toxic to cats and dogs.",

        "What's not to like about philodendrons? Their name is derived from the Greek words philo-, which means 'love,' and dendron â€” the word for 'tree.' Most types of Philodendron can tolerate dark corners and very little watering. 'They like to be on the dry side,' says Sharon Nejman, Senior Horticulturist at Chicago Botanic Garden, so don't fill the watering can more than once per week.",
